            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Blockchain Technology is a decentralized digital ledger system used to record transactions across multiple computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively. It ensures security, transparency, and trust without the need for intermediaries. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and each time a new transaction occurs, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger.</p>
