            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p>Fluid Mechanics is a fundamental branch of Mechanical Engineering that studies the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) and their interactions with forces. It plays a crucial role in various engineering applications including fluid flow in pipelines, air and water systems, and hydraulic machinery. Understanding fluid mechanics is essential for designing efficient systems in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering.</p>
