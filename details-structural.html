            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Structural Engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering that focuses on the design and analysis of structures that support or resist loads. These structures include buildings, bridges, towers, dams, and other infrastructure. Structural engineers ensure that these structures are safe, stable, and able to withstand various forces such as gravity, wind, earthquakes, and thermal effects.</p>
