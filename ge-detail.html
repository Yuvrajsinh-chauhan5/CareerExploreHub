            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Genetic Engineering, also known as genetic modification, is a field of biotechnology that involves altering the genetic material of an organism to achieve desired traits or outcomes. This can include introducing new genes, deleting or modifying existing genes, or combining genes from different species. Genetic Engineering has applications in various fields such as medicine, agriculture, and industry, enabling the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), gene therapies, and improved crop varieties.</p>
