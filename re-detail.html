            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Renewable Energy refers to energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources have minimal environmental impact and play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. Major types of renewable energy include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy.</p>
